# cardano-cda-haskell-homework

This repository contains Haskell exercises and assignments completed during the **Cardano Developer Associate (CDA) Program** by **Emurgo Academy**.  
It serves as a learning workspace for building a solid foundation in functional programming with Haskell — a key step toward writing smart contracts on Cardano using Plutus.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements

- **Haskell Platform** (GHC + Cabal)
- [Install Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/platform/)

### Run a Script

```bash
ghci Recursion.hs
```

Then interact with defined functions in the GHCi REPL.

## 🎓 About the CDA Program

The [Cardano Developer Associate Program](https://education.emurgo.io/) by Emurgo is a technical certification that teaches:

- Haskell fundamentals
- The extended UTxO model
- Smart contract principles with Plutus
- Cardano architecture

This repo was used to practice the Haskell portion of the course.
